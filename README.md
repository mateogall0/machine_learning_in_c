# I did machine learning in C

To try out this model, you have to first obtain the dataset, for this go to the directory "datasets" and execute the Python file "binary_dataset".
Now that the dataset is created, you may go to the "one_neuron" directery and compile it all with
<code>gcc *.c -lm -o neuron</code>
And with that you just execute the file "neuron".

You can always play with the values and see all that can be accomplished with this model, so have fun!
